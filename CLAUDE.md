# Claude Code: ADK Integration for Generative UI System

## Project Context & Goals

You are upgrading a **generative UI business intelligence system** that currently uses a FastAPI bridge to simulate multi-agent behavior. The system has an **excellent production-quality frontend** that demonstrates how real-world applications could interface with ADK agents. It is imperative that you deeply understand the adk documentation and follow those examples http://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/README.md, it is equally imperative that you deeply reason through and understand our existing implementation and upgrade systematically vs creating unneccesarry scaffolds and mocks, this is going to be demonstrated today. Pay attention to this full documentent and create your plan based on this specification:

**Current State**: Sophisticated React dashboard + FastAPI simulation  
**Target State**: Same frontend + authentic ADK multi-agent system  
**Educational Goal**: Show students real ADK agent development while maintaining production UX

## Core Requirements

### 1. **Preserve Existing Frontend Excellence**
- Keep the polished React dashboard (`/dashboard/src/app/page.tsx`)
- Maintain animations, syntax highlighting, agent status indicators
- Preserve the SafeComponentRenderer and all UI components
- **DO NOT** modify the frontend architecture - it's production-ready

### 2. **Replace FastAPI Bridge with Real ADK Agents**
- Convert `/adk_server.py` simulation to authentic ADK agent implementation
- Replace keyword-based routing with actual LLM reasoning and delegation
- Implement proper `@Tool` decorated methods instead of standalone functions
- Enable real agent-to-agent handoffs and coordination

### 3. **Implement Authentic Multi-Agent Architecture**
```python
# Target architecture (reference the provided network diagram):
generative_ui_orchestrator (root)
├── chart_generation_agent
│   ├── create_sales_trend_card
│   ├── create_metric_card
│   └── create_comparison_bar_chart
├── geospatial_agent  
│   ├── create_regional_heatmap_tool
│   ├── create_location_metrics_tool
│   └── create_territory_analysis_tool
├── accessibility_agent
│   ├── create_high_contrast_chart_tool
│   ├── create_screen_reader_table_tool
│   └── create_keyboard_nav_dashboard_tool
└── dashboard_layout_agent
    ├── create_responsive_grid_layout
    └── compose_multi_agent_dashboard
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### **Phase 1: Research & Foundation (Day 1)**

1. **Study Official ADK Repository**
   - Review https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/README.md
   - Study agent creation patterns, tool decoration, and delegation examples
   - Understand ADK session management and web UI integration
   - Note: Follow official ADK patterns, don't invent custom architectures

2. **Analyze Existing Implementation**
   - Examine current tool functions in `/agents/` directory
   - Study the FastAPI bridge logic in `/adk_server.py`
   - Understand frontend expectations from `/dashboard/src/app/page.tsx`
   - Map current keyword routing to required agent reasoning

3. **Plan Integration Strategy**
   - Design ADK agent hierarchy based on existing specialization
   - Plan frontend connection strategy (ADK streaming vs HTTP bridge)
   - Identify minimal changes needed to preserve frontend functionality

### **Phase 2: Core ADK Agent Implementation (Day 2-3)**

1. **Convert Functions to ADK Tools**
```python
# Example conversion:
# BEFORE (current):
def create_sales_trend_card(sales_data: str, period: str) -> str:
    return jsx_string

# AFTER (target):
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
from google.adk.tools import Tool

class ChartGenerationAgent(LlmAgent):
    @Tool
    def create_sales_trend_card(self, sales_data: list, period: str) -> str:
        """Tool that generates sales trend React component with contextual styling."""
        # Use existing JSX generation logic
        return jsx_string
```

2. **Implement Root Orchestrator Agent**
```python
# Root agent with intelligent delegation
class GenerativeUIOrchestratorAgent(LlmAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name="generative_ui_orchestrator",
            instruction="""
            You coordinate business intelligence UI generation by analyzing queries 
            and delegating to specialized UI generation agents.
            
            DELEGATION STRATEGY:
            - Analyze business question for required visualization types
            - Delegate to appropriate specialized agent(s)
            - Each agent uses UI component tools to generate React JSX
            
            AVAILABLE AGENTS:
            - chart_generation_agent: Charts, metrics, trends
            - geospatial_agent: Maps, location analysis  
            - accessibility_agent: WCAG-compliant components
            - dashboard_layout_agent: Multi-component composition
            """,
            sub_agents=[...] # Reference existing agents
        )
```

3. **Preserve Component Generation Logic**
   - Keep all existing JSX generation code from `/agents/` files
   - Wrap existing functions as ADK tools - don't rewrite the UI generation
   - Maintain the excellent component variety and styling

### **Phase 3: Frontend Integration (Day 3-4)**

1. **ADK-to-Frontend Bridge**
   - Study how ADK web interface streams data
   - Implement connection between ADK agents and React dashboard
   - Consider options: WebSocket streaming, HTTP polling, or hybrid approach
   - **Preserve** existing frontend API expectations (`/api/analyze` endpoint)

2. **Maintain Frontend Compatibility**
   - Ensure ADK agent outputs match current frontend expectations
   - Keep the `GeneratedComponent` interface structure
   - Preserve agent status indicators and performance metrics
   - Test that syntax highlighting and component rendering still work

### **Phase 4: Educational Documentation (Day 4-5)**

Create comprehensive teaching guide in `/docs/adk-integration-guide.md`:

```markdown

## Final Notes

This integration represents the **hybrid approach** - preserving production-quality frontend while implementing authentic ADK agent architecture. The goal is showing students that real ADK agents can power sophisticated user interfaces, bridging the gap between educational examples and production systems.

**Remember**: The frontend demonstrates production potential; the ADK backend teaches authentic agent development. Both are essential for comprehensive education.
